I do not like handsets that are huge sized.Camera:Front Facing camera does a wonderful job even under dim light condition compared to the price of the device.Rear facing camera struggles a lot to capture good shots even in bright light. I was using a Mi A1 before this may be this made me think in this way.Battery:So far so good, it lasted more than 24 hours with normal social media usage, I am not a pro user to check with games.Build Quality:Built Quality is excellent, gives us a premium feel.Fingerprint and Face-unlockBoth works so good, the response time is comparatively less with the budget phones.Overall ratting would be 3.5/5.I will include comments later on if there is some issues.
